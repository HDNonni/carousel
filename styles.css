/*
    Styling the Carousel

    1) Set a max-width of 600px & position relative on the div 'carousel'
    2) Hide all 'carousel-item' divs
    3) Make sure all images inside 'carousel-item' have a max-width that matches the main 
    'carousel' div
    4) All images within 'carousel-item' must be responsive, so think about setting a 
    max-width on the images and how you'd make the image 100% width of 'carousel-item' 
    5) We want the first 'carousel-item' to be visible, think about the class we added 
    to the first item. Make sure that class is always shown
    6) The 'carousel-actions' needs to be on top of the slider, so think about positioning 
    and how you can use relative/absolute positioning to put the 'carousel-actions' on top of 
    the slider
    7) Make some beautiful buttons!
    8) Space those buttons from the left & right - we want to make sure they're not touching 
    the edges of the slides, but adequately spaced

/*
    Smooth transitions
    - When a new slide appears that has the class name 'carousel-item-visible'
     we want to trigger an animation...
    
    1) Create a new '@keyframes' at the bottom of this file called 
    'fadeVisibility' - kind of like a JS function! '@keyframes
     fadeVisibility {}'
    2) Keyframes work in steps, so 0-100 on a range.
     Each step you supply changes the animation sequence, 
     e.g. 0% could be hidden and have an opacity of 0, and 100% could be showing 
     he item by having an opacity of 1
    3) Our first keyframe step would be '0%' which sets the opacity to 0, 
    remember that '0%' on our sequence step is not like a regular 
    property/values, you have to use curly braces and then set your 
    values inside there!
    4) Our second keyframe step within 'fadeVisibility' would be '100%', 
    which sets the opacity to 1
    5) Add this keyframe animation to 'carousel-item-visible' 
    by using the property 'animation' and pass our keyframes, 
    those keyframes being 'fadeVisibility'
    7) Lastly after we have added our property and value to
     'carousel-item-visible', we need to pass a time value 
     (i'm going to be using seconds), so after 'animation: 
     fadeVisibility' pass a time value. I'm going to use 0.5s - which should 
     look like this: 'animation: fadeVisibility 0.5s'
    
    Info: So from 0% - 100% in our keyframes we wait 0.5 seconds and go 
    from an opacity of 0, to an opacity of 1!
